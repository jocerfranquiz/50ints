# 50ints

50 Computer Science problems related only to integers, with increasing levels of difficulty.

## Why?

Right now, interviewing processes are evolving into a brainless process where you:
- Have a little chat about what you know
- Have to solve some Leetcode problems that have nothing to do with the job
    + On a Google doc
    + On a fancy and annoying website
- Have a more serious chat with someone who knows about the job
- Maybe you are unfortunate enough to have to do some homework

So, I need to study for interviews, but I want to learn something in the process. Not just to be an expert in Leetcode useless problems.

That's why this repo exists. I have 50 problems and I will solve them in different programming languages. They are only integers, even graphs are made of integers

## Problems

00. Sort a sequence of integers
